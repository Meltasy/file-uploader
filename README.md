# file-uploader
An odin project file-uploader app

This is a mini project to practice my skills:

* using NodeJS and Express to create a file-uploader app
* using prisma ORM to create a database with postgreSQL
* using HTTP methods: get, post, put, delete
* using express-validator to handle validations
* using authentication to give varying access to different users
* using bcrypt (hash and salt) to secure passwords
